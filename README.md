# Quiz (API)

This is a tool to create online Quizes.

This project has been made with educational purposes.

The main idea here was to build a project using NestJS.

## Usage

To run development mode:

```bash
docker-compose up start
```

### Nest CLI

To run commands on Nest CLI:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm nest <COMMAND>
```

### Tests

To run tests:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm npm run test
```

The first time you run the tests might take longer (`mongodb-memory-server` must download the MongoDB binaries).
